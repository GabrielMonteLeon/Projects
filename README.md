Projects

This repository contains a collection of my game development and programming projects from coursework, personal work, and prototypes. 

List of projects in the repository:

Make Every Day Unique: 2D platformer in MonoGame where every level had the same layout but a different gameplay twist.
(Project source available in this repository.)

Wildfire Simulation: A terminal-based simulation coded in C that models the spread of wildfire across a forest grid using probability, neighborhood influence, and time-based burning states. Includes both print mode and live-updating overlay display.
(Project source available in this repository.)

Pong: Created Pong but with the twist of controlling two paddles at once as opposed to the normal one.
